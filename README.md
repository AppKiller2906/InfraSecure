# InfraSecure

The tool is designed to scan your servers and network devices through a centralised server. You can also schedule a scan. This is developed by creating APIs from the existing Tenable Nessus home edition requests and responses.

You just need to change the XX.XX.XX.XX IP address to your centralized server's IP address and you can start scans from any machine. Isn't is it so simple and easy?
